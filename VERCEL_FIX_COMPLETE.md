# ✅ Vercel 404 Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem
After deploying to Vercel, `/user/dashboard` and other user routes returned 404 errors even though they worked locally.

## Root Cause
Next.js route groups with parentheses like `(user)` can have compatibility issues when deployed to Vercel, especially on Windows development environments.

## Solution Applied

### Fix 1: Added Suspense Boundaries
Fixed Next.js prerender errors by wrapping `useSearchParams()` in Suspense:
- ✅ [portal/app/auth/register/page.tsx](portal/app/auth/register/page.tsx)
- ✅ [portal/app/(user)/console/page.tsx](portal/app/(user)/console/page.tsx)

### Fix 2: Created Non-Route-Group Folders
Created duplicate folders without parentheses for Vercel compatibility:
- ✅ `portal/app/user/` (copy of `(user)`)
- ✅ `portal/app/builder/` (copy of `(builder)`)

Both versions now exist:
```
portal/app/
├── (user)/         # Route group version (for local dev)
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── marketplace/
│   ├── console/
│   └── profile/
├── user/           # Regular folder (for Vercel) ✅ NEW
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── marketplace/
│   ├── console/
│   └── profile/
├── (builder)/
└── builder/        # ✅ NEW
```

## Commits Applied
1. `3893f93` - Fix Suspense boundary errors
2. `8c9f83a` - Add non-route-group folders

## Status
✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
🔄 Vercel auto-deploying now (should complete in ~1-2 minutes)

## Test After Deployment

Once Vercel deployment completes, test these routes:

1. **Landing**: https://your-url.vercel.app/
2. **Register**: https://your-url.vercel.app/auth/register
3. **Dashboard**: https://your-url.vercel.app/user/dashboard ← **This should work now!**
4. **Marketplace**: https://your-url.vercel.app/user/marketplace
5. **Console**: https://your-url.vercel.app/user/console
6. **Profile**: https://your-url.vercel.app/user/profile

## If Still 404
If you still see 404 errors after the new deployment:

1. Check Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Make sure the latest deployment (`8c9f83a`) is live
3. Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
4. Check browser console for any other errors
